## Introduction

Our SSH configuration files are in two repos:

  * `sixarm_ssh_config` for the client configuration.

  * `sixarm_sshd_config` for the server configuration.

Take what you need, suggest updates as you can, and when you
do your own Gemfile we recommend specifying your gem versions.

Want to help? We're happy to get pull requests.
