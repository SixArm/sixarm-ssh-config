# UseDNS:
#
# Specifies whether sshd(8) should look up the remote host name and
# check that the resolved host name for the remote IP address maps
# back to the very same IP address.  The default is "yes".
#
# Commentary:
#
# This option is mostly useless. Setting it off speeds up logins.
#
# If the client machines are out there on the Internet, there is a high
# chance that they don't have any reverse DNS, their reverse DNS doesn't
# resolve forward, or their DNS doesn't provide any information other than
# "belongs to this ISP" which the IP address already tells you.
#
# In typical configurations, DNS is only used for logging. It can be used
# for authentication, but only if IgnoreRhosts no is specified in
# sshd_config. This is for compatibility with old installations that used
# rsh, where you can say “the user called bob on the machine called
# darkstar may log in as alice without showing any credentials” (by writing
# darkstar bob in ~alice/.rhosts). It is only secure if you trust all the
# machines that may possibly be connecting to the ssh server. In other
# words, this is very very rarely usable in a secure way.
#
# Given that the DNS lookup doesn't provide any useful information except
# in very peculiar circumstances, it should be turned off. As far as I can
# tell, the only reason it's on by default is that it's technically more
# secure (if you're concerned about authentication, not availability), even
# though that only applies to a tiny set of circumstances.

UseDNS no

# TCPKeepAlive:
#
# Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the
# other side. If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one of
# the machines will be properly noticed. However, this means that
# connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people
# find it annoying.
#
# The default is "yes" (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client
# will notice if the network goes down or the remote host dies. This is
# important in scripts, and many users want it too.
#
# To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to "no".
#
# Commentary:
#
# TCPKeepAlive is dumb. It may seem counterintuitive to shut it off, but it
# will actually force sessions to terminate after a time out.
#
# ClientAlive settings are probably closer to what most people expect when
# they think of "keep alive".
